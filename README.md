# Machine Learning Methods for Fundamental Portfolio Management

This is the code for my thesis: Machine Learning Methods for Fundamental Portfolio Management 

The produced code is my own except for the Reinforcement Learning section, which takes as a basis Liang et al.'s implementation of Policy Gradients (https://github.com/liangzp/Reinforcement-learning-in-portfolio-management-), with further adjustment to ensure fundamental features are used, as well as major debugging and some additional tweaks to their proposed model. We also add the possibility of using LSTMs and NNs (and not only CNNs) when employing their framework.

Data cannot be made public given some of it is subject to vendor payment.
