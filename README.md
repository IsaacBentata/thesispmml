This is the code for my thesis: Machine Learning Methods for Fundamental Portfolio Management 

The produced code is my own except for the Reinforcement Learning section, which employs Liang et al.'s implementation of Policy Gradients,
with further adjustment to ensure fundamental features are used, as well as debugging and some additional tweaks to their
proposed model. We also add the possibility of using LSTMs and NNs (and not only CNNs) when employing their framework.
